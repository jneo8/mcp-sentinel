# MCP Sentinel Problem Statement

## Purpose
Define the incident response gaps Sentinel must solve so responders receive trustworthy, contextualized incident packages without needing to navigate scattered tools or initiate unsafe automation.

## Context & Pain Points
- Alert fatigue: on-call engineers face a barrage of alerts with limited triage guidance.
- Fragmented tooling: investigation data lives across dashboards, ticketing systems, and runbooks, increasing time-to-context.
- Safety risks: ad-hoc scripts and hurried remediation can cause secondary incidents.
- Inconsistent documentation: post-incident artifacts vary in quality, complicating audits and follow-up actions.

## Desired Outcomes
- Alert-driven workflows that automatically gather context and present a single, human-readable incident card.
- Built-in safety checklist that verifies critical facts before the incident is handed to responders.
- Clear routing logic so the right teams receive the right incidents with actionable next steps.
- Transparent audit trail for every automated decision to satisfy compliance and learning needs.

## Target Users & Scenarios
- Site Reliability Engineers triaging high-severity alerts across infrastructure and application layers.
- Platform Operations teams monitoring shared services and needing rapid context for downstream incidents.
- Security responders leveraging Sentinel for read-only enrichment before escalating to human-led remediation.

## Guiding Principles
- Human-first: automation prepares and augments, never executes destructive actions.
- Trustworthy by default: every insight must be sourced, traceable, and verifiable.
- Extensible: accommodate new alert sources, knowledge bases, and communication channels without redesigning the system.
- Resilient under load: maintain usefulness even during alert storms or partial upstream outages.

## Scope & Non-Goals
- In scope: alert intake, contextual data gathering, human-ready incident packaging, safety validation, and notification to collaboration tools.
- Out of scope: automated remediation, write-access changes to production infrastructure, or replacing human incident commanders.

## Success Indicators
- Reduced mean time-to-context for critical alerts compared to current manual workflows.
- Increased responder confidence in automated incident cards, measured through post-incident surveys.
- Lower variance in incident documentation quality and completeness.
- Demonstrable audit logs that pass internal and external review requirements.
